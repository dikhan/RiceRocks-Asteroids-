Brief description: 
This is a 2D space game RiceRocks that is inspired by the classic arcade game Asteroids (1979).

In the game, the player controls a spaceship via four buttons: two buttons that rotate the spaceship 
clockwise or counterclockwise (independent of its current velocity), a thrust button that accelerates 
the ship in its forward direction and a fire button that shoots missiles. Large asteroids spawn randomly 
on the screen with random velocities. The player's goal is to destroy these asteroids before they strike 
the player's ship.
